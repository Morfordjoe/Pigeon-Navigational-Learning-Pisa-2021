# Pigeon-Navigational-Learning-Pisa-2021

GPS tracking data associated with an experiment on navigational learning in homing pigeons conducted in Pisa in 2021. 
The raw data files are provided. Birds were released at two sites (Castelfranco di Sotto and Cecina) and had been exposed to one of the two sites on a previous day.
Birds that had been exposed to the same site as they were subsequently released at were in the experimental treatment, and birds that had been exposed at the other site were the controls. 

An example filename: DRS049567Castelfranco 421.csv__
DRS = Different Release Site (control treatment) (vs SRS = Same Release Site (experimental treatment));
049567 = Bird ring number
Castelfranco = Release site (vs Cecina = Release site)
421 = GPS number
